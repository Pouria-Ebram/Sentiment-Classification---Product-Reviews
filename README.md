# Sentiment-Classification-Product-Reviews

Sentiment analysis also known as opinion mining is a subfield within Natural Language Processing (NLP) that builds machine learning algorithms to classify a text according to the sentimental polarities of opinions it contains, e.g., positive or negative. In recent years, sentiment analysis has become a topic of great interest and development in both academics and industry. Analyzing the
sentiment of texts could benefit, for example, customer services, product analytics, market research etc. In this data analysis challenge, the project focuses on developing such an automatic sentiment classification system that relies on machine learning techniques to learn from a large set of product reviews provided by Yelp. The levels of polarity of opinion considered include strong negative, weak negative, neutral, weak positive, and strong positive. So, the challenge was to develop a sentiment classifier that can assign a large set of product reviews to the five levels of polarity of opinion as accurately as possible, given a small amount of labeled reviews and a large amount of unlabeled reviews.
